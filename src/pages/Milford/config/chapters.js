    description: `Experience the stunning beauty of New Zealand's natural landscapes on the Milford Track, one of the world's greatest walks. Traverse through majestic mountains 🏔️, crystal-clear lakes 💦, and lush forests 🌳, while immersing yourself in the country's rich flora and fauna 🦜. <br> <br> 🚤 Before getting there you'll need to sort out transport to the start of the track ... The most popular way is catching a ferry from Te Anau Downs using companies such as <a href="https://www.fiordlandoutdoors.co.nz/transport-and-experiences/milford-track-transport/">Fiordland Outdoors</a>, <a href="https://www.tracknet.net/tracks/milford">Tracknet</a> or <a href="https://www.realnz.com/en/experiences/ferry-services/milford-track-transfers/">RealNZ</a>. These companies will also sort out your transport on the other side of the track and can include a bus back to Te Anau Downs, Te Anau or Queenstown.  <br> <br> 🥾 The most hardcore of the hikers can also consider taking the eight hour hike over <a href="https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/fiordland/places/fiordland-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/dore-pass-route/">Dore Pass</a> 😱`,

The Bus Stop Shelter is another small shelter and is a must-stop if the rain is heavy or the river level is too high to cross safely, as it provides protection and shelter for hikers.",

    description:
      "Mintaro Hut provides stunning views of the surrounding mountains and is a great place to rest and refuel for the journey ahead. The Mackinnon Pass is the highest point on the track that offers breathtaking views of the surrounding mountain peaks and valleys. If hikers arrive early and the weather is clear, it is worth dropping off their packs at the hut and taking a side trip to the Mackinnon Pass Memorial, which honors the track's builder, Quintin Mackinnon. The memorial is often shrouded in clouds in the mornings, so hiking to it when the weather is clear is a rare opportunity to take in the stunning views from the pass.",

From there, hikers can choose to take a side trip to Sutherland Falls, which involves a 1 hour detour that leads to the base of the falls. The falls are one of the highest in New Zealand, and the view from the base is well worth the extra effort.",

As you make your way towards the end of your journey, you'll pass by Bell Rock, a massive boulder that has been hollowed out inside and worth climbing inside. Fun fact: up to 18 Japanese tourists have fit inside Bell Rock at once.",

The area of the Milford track was heavily affected by the 2020 Fiorland flooding. As you approach Sandfly Point, the path becomes wider due to historic work trying to build a horse & carriage track from Milford Sound to Sutherland Falls. Finally, you'll reach Sandfly Point, the end of the Milford Track, where you can catch a boat to Milford Sound and celebrate the completion of your incredible journey! 🚣",
